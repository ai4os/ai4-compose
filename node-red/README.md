# ![FlowFuse Logo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122208269?s=200&v=4) NodeRED-based solution

This repository contains a collection of nodes and interaction flows for [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) specifically designed to interact with OSCAR. It includes example workflows, reusable subflows, and a Dockerfile for deploying a pre-configured Node-RED instance with all necessary dependencies.

## Available Nodes

You can find all the custom OSCAR-related nodes grouped in the following collection:

## Getting Started

To run the subflows (nodes) or workflows (examples) locally, you must install the following Node-RED dependencies:

### OSCAR Subflow dependencies:

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-string
npm install node-red-node-base64
```

### Workflow example dependencies:

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-time_interval
npm install node-red-contrib-image-output
npm install node-red-contrib-exec-queue
npm install node-red-contrib-minio-all
npm install node-red-dashboard
npm install node-red-contrib-play-audio
```

## Using FlowFuse on AI4EOSC

If you have access to the AI4EOSC Flows infrastructure, you can use Node-RED directly through FlowFuse without installing anything locally.

Simply register or log in at:  
ðŸ‘‰ [https://forge.flows.dev.ai4eosc.eu/](https://forge.flows.dev.ai4eosc.eu/)

You will have access to a ready-to-use Node-RED instance with OSCAR integration.

---

## Dockerfile

This repository includes a `Dockerfile` to build a ready-to-use Node-RED instance with all necessary subflows and dependencies to communicate with OSCAR.

Build it with:

```bash
docker build -t your_image_name .
```

By default, the login credentials are:  
**Username:** `admin`  
**Password:** `admin`  
You can modify this in the `settings.js` file. More info:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Securing Node-RED](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red)

---

## Workflows and Examples

Explore the `examples` directory for complete workflows using the Node-RED dashboard to orchestrate services provided by OSCAR. These examples are a great starting point if you're new to the platform.

---

## Subflows

The `subflows` directory contains reusable components in JSON format. These can be imported directly into Node-RED for testing or as templates to create your own.
