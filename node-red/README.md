# NodeRED-based solution
In this folder, nodes and interaction flows of NodeRED (https://nodered.org/) with OSCAR are located. In addition to the examples of workflows.

To run the subflows (nodes) or workflows (examples), it is necessary to install the following nodes (dependencies) for everything to work correctly.

OSCAR subflow :

     • node-red-contrib-string (npm install node-red-contrib-string)
     • node-red-node-base64 ( npm install node-red-node-base64)

Example workflow execution:
      
     • node-red-contrib-time_interval (npm install node-red-contrib-time_interval)
     • node-red-contrib-image-output (npm install node-red-contrib-image-output)
     • node-red-contrib-exec-queue (npm install node-red-contrib-exec-queue)
     • node-red-contrib-minio-all (npm install node-red-contrib-minio-all)
     • node-red-dashboard (npm install node-red-dashboard)
     • node-red-contrib-play-audio (npm install node-red-contrib-play-audio)
