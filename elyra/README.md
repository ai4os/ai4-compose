# ![Elyra Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai4os/ai4-compose/main/img/elyra-horizontal-color.svg) Elyra-based solution

This repository contains examples of how to use [OSCAR](https://oscar.egi.eu) with Elyra to create and manage AI pipelines in JupyterLab. It includes ready-to-use components that demonstrate the capabilities of Elyra and OSCAR in the context of AI workflows.

## Available Nodes

These are the nodes currently included in this repository. Each one can be deployed as a service in OSCAR using its corresponding container image:

- **Cowsay**  
  A fun demonstration node that makes a cow say the input text provided via environment variable.  
  Docker image: `ghcr.io/grycap/cowsay:latest`

- **Grayify**  
  Converts an input image to grayscale. Useful for preprocessing tasks in computer vision workflows.  
  Docker image: `ghcr.io/grycap/imagemagick:latest`

- **Plant Classification**  
  A classification node that takes an image of a plant and predicts its species using a trained model.  
  Docker image: `ai4oshub/plants-classification`

- **YOLOv8 Inference**  
  Performs object detection on input images using a YOLOv8 model. Ideal for detecting objects in real-time data pipelines.  
  Docker image: `ai4oshub/ai4os-yolov8-torch`

## Installation

If Elyra is not yet installed on your JupyterLab, you can install it by following these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Install Elyra using pip:

```bash
pip install elyra && jupyter lab build
```

### Installation of Elyra with All Extensions

For a comprehensive installation of Elyra with all its extensions in the latest version, please review the official Elyra documentation at:  
https://elyra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/installation.html

The command to install Elyra with all extensions is:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade "elyra[all]"
```

This will ensure that you have all the necessary extensions to fully utilize the capabilities of Elyra.

3. If necessary, restart JupyterLab.

## Using Elyra on EGI Notebooks

If you are a member of a [Virtual Organization (VO)](https://www.egi.eu/virtual-organisations/) within the EGI infrastructure, you can use Elyra directly without installing anything locally. Simply log in to:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://notebooks.egi.eu/](https://notebooks.egi.eu/)

Once logged in, youâ€™ll have access to a JupyterLab environment that includes Elyra.

---

## Starting JupyterLab Locally

To start JupyterLab on your machine:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

3. Start JupyterLab by running:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

A new browser window or tab should open with JupyterLab.

## Using the Examples

Once JupyterLab is running, navigate to the `examples` folder. There, you will find complete pipeline examples and individual components. These serve as templates to help you build your own pipelines using Elyra and OSCAR.

Take advantage of Elyraâ€™s graphical pipeline editor to visually compose, configure, and run your workflows.

To better understand how Elyra pipelines work within AI4EOSC, consult the official guide:
